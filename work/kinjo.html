						<h3>Object</h3>
						<p class="work-last-para">With 12-year history, KINJO is the top one metalworking & workshop brand in Taiwan. Now they have 8 stores, attracting 1,800 tourists to experience handmade rings every month. The purpose of this project came up with an e-commerce site to collect customers’ data, manage orders and courses booking, and give KINJO a brand new digital image. To improve the efficiency of maketing strategy and sales.</p>
						<h3>Approach</h3>
						<p class="work-last-para">The project scope is quite large so we have two designers participated in, my dear partner is Cece. Firstly, we analyzed the original site’s performance and platforms they used to know more about target audience. Then we spend a lot of time on organizing the information architecture for the new website, for their customized services and course booking process are complicated. After we have a clearer consensus on brand strategy between us and client, we started crafting pages.</p>
						<h3>My Role</h3>
						<p class="work-last-para">During the kickoff phase, I was responsible for market research and brand strategy. For some complicated process, I did a lot of research, drew the flow chart, and discuss with team. Then we worked together on page design. I worked more on design system with front-end developer and symbols organized on sketch.</p>

					<p class="inverse-text work-last-para">It is not only an e-commerce site, but all the business of KINJO need to integrate together. For designers, we had to digest heavy content to be well presented. For developers, they concerned of the loading of the site. And for the first time, our team members want to figure out how to cooperate well between designers, developers and even clients on such a big project.</p>

					<h3>Kickoff</h3>
					<p>Firstly, we used <a class="a-underlined-link" href="https://saliejung.com/pdf/similarweb_website-analysis-overview-report_dec-2018.pdf">Similar Web</a> to analyze the original website and we found that about 67% of visits were from organic search, which means high brand awareness. However, customers can only get limited information from blogger and facebook business page, rather than the official website. Therefore, we spent a lot of time discussing with the client about optimizing all the user experiences and organizing the information hierarchy for the new website.</p>

					<h3>Research</h3>
					<p>Rings are not a simple product, it is about the size, the personalized engraving, and the materials. Besides, course booking is also complicated, the biggest question is how to sync remaining seats within date, time and stores. To thought comprehensively, we worked with developers during the research phase to prevent technical limitations as far as possible.</p>
					<p class="work-last-para">We provided some selected design references for the client. After discussion, we defined the design direction will be “Storytelling” like the brand motto “A Memory to Remeber”. From online experience to products and workshop, we would like customers to feel the brand from the heart and keep it as a beautiful memory in mind.</p>

					<h3>Flowchart</h3>
					<p>By interviewed the client and some potential customers, we concluded the user stories to multiple scenarios:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>I want to make two rings at the same time, so I reserve 2 courses for only 1 customer.</li>
						<li>I want to reserve a course for my friend as a gift, so I cannot decide when will she like to take the course.</li>
						<li>I am going to travel to Taiwan for 5 days, however, there are no remaining seats.</li>
						<li>If I only reserve the course, then I do not have to fill out the address during checkout.</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="work-last-para">However, the process and requirements are getting complicated, we had to narrow down to simplify it. After frequent discussion with the developers and confirmed with the client, we drew the flowchart to double check all the situations can be satisfied.</p>
